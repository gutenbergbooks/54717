  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The epic is a drama on gigantic scale; its acts are years
or centuries; its actors, heroes; its stage, the world of life;
its events, those mighty cycles of activity that leave their
deep impress on human history. Homer’s epics reënact
the stirring scenes of the ten years’ siege of Troy, and the
perilous, long wanderings of Ulysses before he reached his
home; Vergil’s epic action embraces the fall of Troy and
the never-ending struggles of Æneas and his band of exiles
till Troy should rise again in the western world; Tasso
pictures the heroic war of Godfrey and his crusaders, who
strove to free the holy city of Jerusalem; and Milton,
ignoring all bounds of time and space, fills his triple stage
of heaven, earth, and hell with angels, men, and devils,
all working out the most stupendous problems of human
destiny.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such gigantic dramas could be presented on no human
stage. But in them all are lesser actions of marked dramatic
possibility. Notable among these are the events
culminating in the death of Hector, the home coming of
Ulysses and his destruction of the suitors, Satan’s rebellion
and expulsion from heaven, and the temptation and fall of
man. All these furnish abundant material for the tragic
stage; but all leave much to be supplied of speech and
action before the full-rounded drama could take form. In
the <em>Æneid</em> alone is found, among the minor parts which
make up the epic whole, a dramatic action well-nigh complete—the
love story of Æneas and Dido.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>The ordinary student of Vergil is too much engrossed
with an intensive study of the text, and has too near a view
of the poem, to appreciate how fully this story is worked
out in detail; how its speech, action, and events all lead to
a dramatic climax. There is need only here and there of
an interpolated lyric upon some suggested theme, a bit of
Vergil’s description of action or feeling expressed in the
actor’s words, an interjected line to relieve the strain of too
long speech—all else is Vergil’s own, ready to be lifted out
of its larger epic setting and portrayed upon the stage.</p>

<p class='c000'>In arranging and translating this epic tragedy, the authors
have made only such minor additions and alterations of the
original as seemed necessary from the dramatic point of
view. Prominent among these are the introduction of
lyrics at certain points, the obviously necessary curtailing
of the banquet scene by the omission of the long narrative
of Æneas, and the removal behind the scenes of the
final tragedy of Dido’s suicide. The lyrical parts have
been set to original music in sympathy with the themes;
stage action and scenery are suggested by outline drawings
of the different settings; and idealized figures and costumes
are reproduced from ancient vases and bas-reliefs. These
figures have, in some cases, been assigned by scholars to
other subjects; but they may be taken, for the purposes
of the present work, as illustrative of the characters
designated.</p>

<p class='c000'>With full consciousness of the shortcomings of the work,
but with the hope also of assisting the student in school
and home to a fuller appreciation of the power and beauty
of Vergil, this volume is respectfully presented to the
public.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The first edition of this volume, containing only the
<em>Dido: An Epic Tragedy</em>, a dramatization of the love story of
Æneas and Dido, was published in 1900, and met with a
gratifying success. Teachers of Vergil have found the
book an interesting supplement to their study and presentation
of the text; and in numerous instances high-school
and college classes have staged the play with most excellent
results.</p>

<p class='c000'>The book has been out of print for several years; but
the continued demand from teachers who desire to use it
has made a second edition desirable. This is accordingly
offered in the present volume, under a new title, and containing
a second dramatization from Vergil—this from the
second <em>Æneid</em>, the story of the Fall of Troy.</p>

  <h3 class='c003'>THE ARGUMENT</h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'><em>For ten years the Greeks had besieged Troy, and on the
tenth they took and utterly destroyed that ancient city. The
inhabitants who had escaped captivity and the sword, wandered
in exile to many quarters of the earth. Now the chief
band of exiles was led by Æneas, son of Venus and Anchises,
and son-in-law of Priam, king of Troy.</em></p>

<p class='c000'><em>After many adventures on land and sea, Æneas came, in
the sixth year, to Sicily, where he was kindly entertained by
Acestes, king of that land, and where his aged father died
and was buried. Thence setting sail in the summer of the
seventh year, he approached the shores of Africa. Here a
violent storm arose which scattered and all but destroyed the
Trojan ships. Æneas, with a number of his companions,
was cast upon a desert coast, where they passed the night
in gloomy forebodings. In the early morning, Æneas and
Achates set forth to explore the land, and came to the newly
founded city of Carthage.</em></p>

<p class='c000'><em>Now Phœnician Dido, also, with a band of exiles, had fled
from her native Tyre, to escape the persecutions of her brother,
Pygmalion, who had already slain Sychæus, her husband.
And to the land of Africa had she come, and built her a city,
even the city of Carthage.</em></p>

<p class='c000'><em>And so these two, Æneas, prince of Troy, and Dido, fugitive
from Tyre, now meet in distant Africa and live the
tragedy which fate has held in store.</em></p>

<p class='c011'>Early morning; the open square before the temple of Juno on a height near
Carthage. In the distance (see cut, 1, 2, 3) appear mountains, and at their
foot lies the city, clustered about the harbor where ships are riding at anchor.
The effect of elevation is increased by the unfinished columns and the tree-tops
just showing above the low marble wall which encloses the square. This
scene (4) is set nearer than 1, 2, 3, to increase the perspective.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the first wing on the right (5), a colonnade, leading to a flight of steps,
forms the entrance from the city below. On the same side, along the wall, is a
broad marble seat (6), shaded by a wild crab tree, pink with bloom. The
dark rug on the step before it is strewn with fallen petals. On the left is the
front of the temple (7). Two large columns of white marble flank three
broad steps leading to the platform. Above these columns, the architrave
bears a frieze representing scenes from the Trojan war. Before the temple
door is an altar on which fire is burning.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the rise of the curtain, a chorus of Carthaginian maidens, clad in white,
are seen kneeling before the altar on the temple steps; they sing a greeting
to the dawn.</p>

as their voices grow fainter Æneas and Achates kneel before the altar. The

      <div class='line'>Such violence and such high-handed deeds a race</div>

      <div class='line'>In honor of their mighty leader have the place</div>

      <div class='line'>A few of us have drifted. But alas! what race</div>
      <div class='line'>Of men is this? What land permits such savage deeds</div>
      <div class='line'>As these? We are refused the barren refuge of</div>
      <div class='line'>The sandy shore; they seek a cause for mortal strife,</div>
      <div class='line'>And will not that we set our feet upon the land.</div>

<p class='c011'>A place in the deep, green forest. Ferns and flowers strew the ground and
the sunlight falls through the branches in flecks of gold. In the foreground are
two great moss-grown rocks, on one of which sits Cupid, draped with garlands
of wild flowers, shooting his arrows at a heart-shaped target hung from
the branches of a tree in the center of the stage. At one side sits Venus,
absorbed in deep, troubled meditation. She has resumed the flowing draperies
befitting a goddess. Pink or canary yellow will harmonize with the

<p class='c000'>Suddenly her face is lighted with a new thought. She goes to Cupid and

<p class='c000'>As she unfolds her plan, Cupid is filled with delight. He struts up and
down, comically imitating Ascanius. When his mother has finished, he hastens
to pick up his scattered arrows, puts them in his quiver, and struts off, looking
back for his mother’s smile of approval. Curtain.</p>

out over the moonlit sea. Two broad steps lead from the colonnade to a landing,
from which again three steps at each side descend to the level of the hall
(3). At the second wing (4) on each side, curtained doorways open into the
side rooms, from which the servants hurry with viands for the table. At the first
wing (5), half columns form the corner of the wall. In the center a sort of triclinium
(6) is set for the feast, a broad, three-sided table flanked by couches
upholstered in Tyrian purple and having pillows of blue and gold.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the curtain rises, the moonlight is streaming down through the columns
upon the scene. A tripod burns before the triclinium. Otherwise there is no
light except as it flashes from the side rooms when the curtains are parted
for an instant. Servants are strewing the banquet table with flowers and
bringing in dishes of gold.</p>

one, till the scene is brilliant with light and color.</p>

<p class='c000'>Music is heard within. The servants hastily finish their work. The royal
party enters along the colonnade. Dido is still clad in white, but Anna and the
other ladies of the court have assumed himations of royal purple, royal blue,
brilliant yellow, and deep green. Æneas has laid aside his helmet and greaves,
but still wears his breastplate of mail, although he carries on his shoulder a
cloak of royal purple.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>The Carthaginians are more elaborately and richly dressed than in the first

<p class='c011'>Dido’s chamber. At the left, in front, is a shrine (1). An antique bust with
an inscription above it, visible in the light from the glowing censer, indicates
that it is sacred to Synchæus. Two broad steps raise it slightly from the level
of the stage. On the same side in the middle a door (2), flanked by half
columns. At the right, first wing, a door (3); half-way back on the same side
(4), a curtained recess in which are hung Dido’s brilliant robes. In the center
of the background (5), is a window overlooking the city and harbor, which
show in the distance when the window is opened. It is reached by two steps
covered with rugs, and the seats about the three sides of the recess are richly
upholstered in green and gray.</p>

<p class='c000'>Anna and Dido both wear simple white, while Barce, the aged nurse, is clad
plainly in brown.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barce lies asleep on a couch near the shrine, her face lighted by the glowing
flame. Anna is asleep on a couch in the foreground.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dido sits at the window in the moonlight, looking out into the night. She
gets up and moves restlessly about the room. She kneels before the altar,
replenishing the incense. She comes finally to her sister, and, wakening her,
tells of her struggle against the new love.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dido, during this speech, has gone to her husband’s shrine. There is a
mighty struggle in her soul between love and duty.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barce, wakened from her sleep and seeing her mistress pale and anguish-stricken,
throws herself before her. Dido finally yields and reaches her trembling
hand to quench the censer. The old nurse clings to her in terrified appeal.
Dido frees herself from her. She quenches the flame and draws the curtain
before the shrine. Old Barce sits sobbing before the darkened altar.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile the light has been changing into dawn and the sea and harbor
begin to be visible through the open window. Dido crosses the chamber, and
after a moment’s struggle draws back the curtains from before the recess where
hang the brilliant garments laid aside during her widowhood. She takes down
a purple mantle, and standing before a mirror, girds it about her with a golden
girdle.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sound of a trumpet and the shouts of the sailors are heard in the distance.
Anna goes to the window, and seeing Æneas and his men below on the
shore, draws Dido to the window. Dido gazes for a minute and then, filled
with her new passion, goes forth with her sister to meet Æneas. Curtain.</p>

<p class='c011'>A fragrant nook on Mount Ida. Across the stage at the first wing a low,
broad marble wall (1), forming one end of a colonnade which leads back to an
arch (2), through which the distant sea is visible (3). The columns at the first
wing (4) and the wall between them are over-clambered by a flowering vine,
which has strewn its delicate yellow petals over the wall and the marble floor
before it. Behind the wall (5) a garden of brilliant blossoms, with a path
leading through it to the arch in the background. There is the pleasant sound
of falling water.</p>

<p class='c000'>Venus, seated upon the low marble wall is discovered keeping watch over
Ascanius who lies asleep before her his pink body hidden in a drift of yellow
petals. The deep blue himation, which has fallen in graceful folds across the
wall behind her, forms a rich contrast in color to the delicate tints of the
marble, of the flowers, and of her own dress of tender pink. Juno in a brilliant
purple dress, approaching through the garden, comes upon her in a fury

broken bow. As the sound of the trumpets grows fainter, a band of Carthaginian

the direction of the hunt with a gesture of impatience.</p>

The old nurse, Barce, is bustling about, hanging up her mistress’
brilliant robes, which she has cast aside for her old mourning gown of simple
white. Dido is seated at the latticed window watching the Trojans in the
harbor below prepare for their departure. She is weeping.</p>

<p class='c000'>The shouts of the sailors are heard. Dido groans. Anna, hastily putting

<p class='c000'>Dido, at the window, watches her sister as she takes her way down to the
harbor. When she can no longer see her in the gathering twilight, she turns
with a sigh to her chamber.</p>

<p class='c000'>The old nurse, Barce, totters to her. Dido places her head wearily on the
old woman’s shoulder. Barce, drawing her to a couch, tries to soothe her.
Dido starts up in terror, as if she saw some fearful shape. She flees before it
to her husband’s shrine, and is only recalled from the fancy when she finds the
curtains drawn before it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barce comes tremblingly to her. Dido in bitter remorse draws the curtains
from the shrine and kneels before it. Barce hurries away and soon returns
with a lighted candle, which she brings to her mistress. Dido lights the
censer. Curtain.</p>

with flowers; fire glows on the altar. Barce sits spinning at one side.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dido is pacing the room with fierce energy. She goes to the window from
time to time, then renews her fierce walking to and fro. Suddenly she presses
her hand to her head as if a new thought had come to her. Her face assumes
an expression of cunning. She picks up a golden goblet, and with a gesture
to the old woman sends her to fill it.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Barce has gone, Dido stealthily but quickly takes Æneas’ sword from
the wall, and, seating herself, with trembling fingers draws it from its scabbard.
She feels the edge, shrinking in terror at the thought of her intended
suicide. With a shudder, she presses the cold blade against her neck.</p>

<p class='c000'>As she is thus meditating, her sister is heard coming. Dido quickly conceals
the sword beneath the draperies of the couch. She assumes an air of gayety,
kissing her sister and drawing her to a seat.</p>

<p class='c000'>Anna assents to her plan and hurries away to execute it. Dido quickly
takes the sword from its hiding-place and in tremulous haste hangs it again
upon the wall. Barce enters. Dido turns, fearing detection, but seeing that

and drains it. Curtain.</p>

<p class='c000'>The servants rush in terrified during her passionate speech, and as she utters
her curse, stand cowering before her. She dismisses with a gesture all except

<p class='c000'>She rushes forth from the chamber in her frenzy. The sailors’ chorus is
repeated fainter and fainter. In a moment her death cry is heard. The servants
rush in, and finding their mistress gone, hasten in the direction of her cry.
Their lamentation is heard. They return bearing the body of the queen upon
a couch. She has fainted, and upon her bosom the wound shows red and
terrible. Anna enters, beside herself with grief.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Anna</em>, kneeling beside the couch, addresses Dido, who revives enough to
smile upon her sister (676-685):</p>

<p class='c000'>The sailors’ chorus sounds in the distance. Aroused by this, the dying

<p class='c011'>The plain in front of Troy; the city walls; the sea; and, in the distance,
Tenedos. Morning, without the gates. Joyful crowds of men, women, and
children pour through the open doors. They gather about the strange wooden
horse which stands without, and excitedly inquire what it means, and what
shall be done with it. Thymoetes voices the sentiment of one party that it
should be taken within the walls and set upon the citadel; while Capys and
his adherents urge that they should examine the mystery where it stands, and
destroy it. Great confusion reigns. The sentiment of Thymoetes seems about
to prevail (26-39).</p>

      <div class='line'>All Greeks are judged alike.</div>

      <div class='line'>When this dire oracle among the crowd,</div>

      <div class='line'>They trembling ask for whom the fates prepare,</div>

      <div class='line'>Then comes the Ithacan with clamor loud,</div>
      <div class='line'>The prophet Calchas dragging in our midst,</div>
      <div class='line'>And bids with charge insistent that he tell</div>
      <div class='line'>The will of heaven. And now from many lips</div>
      <div class='line'>The grim forebodings of Ulysses’ guile</div>
      <div class='line'>Assail my ears, while all in silence wait</div>
      <div class='line'>To see the end. Ten days the seer was mute,</div>

      <div class='line'>To her outraged divinity. And more—</div>
      <div class='line'>The prophet bade them form an image huge</div>
      <div class='line'>Of oaken beams, of such proportions vast</div>
      <div class='line'>That through no gate of Troy could it be led,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor set within the walls, lest thus once more</div>

<p class='c011'>A street of Troy, lit by the moonlight and the glare of burning buildings.
Trojans rush in from different sides and rally to Æneas.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Æneas</em> (348-354):</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>O comrades, O ye hearts most brave in vain,</div>
      <div class='line'>If you have steadfast minds to follow one</div>
      <div class='line'>On desperate deeds intent, you see our case:</div>
      <div class='line'>The gods, who long have buttressed up our state,</div>
      <div class='line'>Have fled their sacred altars and their shrines,</div>
      <div class='line'>And left us to our fate. You seek to aid</div>
      <div class='line'>A city wrapped in flames. Then let us die</div>
      <div class='line'>And in the midst of death our safety find:</div>
      <div class='line'>Our safety’s single hope—to hope for none.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The little band hurries off toward the noise of battle in neighboring streets.
Enter from the other direction straggling bands of Greeks, drunk with victory.
They burn and pillage on all sides, temples and homes alike. Re-enter
Trojans led by Æneas. Androgeos, a Greek, thinking them to be Greeks,
goes up to them.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Androgeos</em> (373-375):</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Now haste ye, men; what time for sloth is this?</div>
      <div class='line'>The rest on fire and pillage are intent,</div>
      <div class='line'>While you but now address you to the task.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Androgeos suddenly perceives that these are foes, and is struck dumb with
amazement. The Trojans rush upon him and slay him together with the
others of his band.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Corœbus</em>, one of Æneas’ band, exultingly (387-391):</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>O friends, where kindly fortune first doth show</div>

      <div class='line'>With these slain Greeks let us our shields exchange,</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>In all things seem as Greeks. When foemen strive,</div>

      <div class='line'>Our foes against themselves shall lend us arms.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>They exchange arms with the dead Greeks. Thus arrayed, they mingle with
the parties of Greeks who straggle in, and slay them. The Greeks, not understanding
this strange turn of affairs, flee away in terror. This action is
repeated at intervals several times.</p>

<p class='c000'>Enter a band of Greeks led by Ajax, the Atridæ, and others, dragging Cassandra
roughly along by the hair. Her hands are tied with thongs. Corœbus,
though the odds are overwhelmingly against him, rushes in to save his beloved
Cassandra. The other Trojans, because of their disguise of Greek armor, are
attacked by their own friends stationed at near by points of vantage, and now
the Greeks themselves, recognizing the ruse at last, overwhelm the little Trojan
band by force of numbers. Other Greeks pour in from all sides and add their
testimony that these are Trojans. In the desperate encounter many of the
Trojans fall.</p>

<p class='c000'>Æneas performs Herculean feats of arms, and slays many Greeks, but is
himself unhurt. At last he and a few followers escape into a street leading to
Priam’s palace, whence loud and continued shouting can be heard.</p>

<h4 class='c010'><span class='sc'>Scene 3</span></h4>

<p class='c011'>At Priam’s palace (viewed from without), desperately attacked by Greeks
and defended by Trojans. (<em>a</em>) The assailants attempt by scaling ladders to
mount to the flat, turreted roof of the palace, while the defendants hurl down
upon these darts and stones, and pry off whole towers which fall with a mighty
crash. The air is filled with the thunderous noise of these falling masses and
with the other confused shouts and sounds of a desperate conflict.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>b</em>) Pyrrhus with a strong band of Greeks is endeavoring to batter down the
gates of the palace at its main entrance.</p>

<p class='c011'>Priam’s palace from within. All is confusion and terror. Women rush
from room to room, with disheveled hair streaming, and with cries of wild
despair. A crowded mass of men are attempting to defend the main entrance.
Overhead can be seen and heard the defenders on the roof opposing the
attack from without.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the central open court of the palace, upon the steps of a great altar overshadowed
by a laurel tree, Hecuba and a group of women have seated themselves,
huddling there in the hope of protection from the sanctity of the altar.
Suddenly old Priam comes out into the court, hurriedly adjusting his armor.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span><em>Hecuba</em>, calling to him (519-524):</p>

    </div>

<p class='c011'>A dark street near the Ida gate. Æneas, Anchises, and Ascanius as before.
Suddenly through the darkness there comes the distant sound of feet and
shouting as of pursuers.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Anchises</em>, peering in the direction of the sound (733, 734):</p>

<p class='c011'>At the ancient temple of Ceres without the walls. The fugitives come
straggling in in various bands, a motley array, Æneas and his immediate followers
among the rest. Æneas watches them as they come and gather about
him, counting and identifying them. He now discovers that Creüsa is missing.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Æneas</em> (738-748):</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
